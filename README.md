# toscrape

## img crawler

Download images from books.toscrape.com using the Images pipeline.
The name of the downloaded images is a serial number that corresponds to their position in the catalog. Like: 0001.jpg, 0002.jpg ...
You can change where the download starts, so how many images are downloaded, by rewriting the start_urls = variable. See: toscrape/spiders/img.py

To run, enter:


```
scrapy crawl img
```

The download location will be the downloads/files folder. (settings.py)

## control crawler

The middleware controls the crawl and stops it if the "CONTROL_XPATH" condition is false. Once you have done the necessary things with the browser - in this case following a link - the crawl will continue after you hit Enter. Selenium with Firefox.

```
scrapy crawl control
```
